# SectorLabsCodingChallenge

Notes:

Actually, I gave up on the django idea because I was unable to connect to any github account. I'll continue with this as a react project.

The project strucutre is a django project structure. I made it this way in case I will have time to implement some extra backend functionalities. I will mainly be working on the frontend.
